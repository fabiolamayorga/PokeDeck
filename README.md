# PokeDeck

Hi my name is Fabiola! and this is my version the PokeDeck.
For this app I used the Pokemon API, React-Redux, Material UI and of course React.

## Installation

To install and start the app you should use the following npm commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

- To move across the list of Pokemons just hit the arrow button.
- The search box will return a list with the Pokemons from 1 to 150. You can hit the search box and it will show a list with the Pokemons names or you just can write the name of the Pokemon.
